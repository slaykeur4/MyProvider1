Cryptographic provider


The cryptographic provider called “Myprovider”. Myprovider implements necessary algorithms to build an application that signs and verifies the signature of any document using myProvider. 

The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) is a set of packages that provides a framework and implementations for encryption, key generation and key agreement, and Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms. Support for encryption includes symmetric, asymmetric, block, and stream ciphers. The software also supports secure streams and sealed objects.  JCE is an integral part of Java 2 SDK, v 1.4, and later releases.
